/***************************** NOTE TO USERS *********************************
 *
 *                 THIS IS A HEADER FILE, NOT A MANUAL
 *
 *    If you want to know how to use FFTW, please read the manual,
 *    online at http://www.fftw.org/doc/ and also included with FFTW.
 *    For a quick start, see the manual's tutorial section.
 *
 *   (Reading header files to learn how to use a library is a habit
 *    stemming from code lacking a proper manual.  Arguably, it's a
 *    *bad* habit in most cases, because header files can contain
 *    interfaces that are not part of the public, stable API.)
